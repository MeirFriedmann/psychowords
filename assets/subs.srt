First of all, I'm not even robbing you.
This machine doesn't even belong to you.

346
00:22:15,544 --> 00:22:18,964
-Belongs to the bank, the real criminals.
-You're the criminal. You're robbing me.

347
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:22,092
You know, I can't really get a job
anywhere anymore, being like this.

348
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:23,635
So I've turned to a life of crime.

349
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:25,637
-Why do people say "ATM machine"?
-[Spot] Huh?

350
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:28,432
-Who said that?
-The M stands for "Machine."

351
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:30,851
Spider-Man! [yelps]

352
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:32,352
Ow!

353
00:22:33,437 --> 00:22:35,898
Hey, Lenny, how much do I owe you
for this beef patty, man?

354
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:39,067
Spidey, if you catch him,
it's on the house, brother.

355
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:42,487
[Spot] Oh, Spider-Man. Wow. [yells]

356
00:22:42,571 --> 00:22:46,408
-This is real!
-So are you, like, a cow or a Dalmatian?

357
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:47,659
I am...

-We meet again, Spider-Man.

361
00:22:55,751 --> 00:22:57,920
-That's funny to you?
-Of course not. No.

362
00:22:58,003 --> 00:22:59,588
So is that a costume?

363
00:22:59,671 --> 00:23:01,548
Unfortunately for both of us,
this is skin.

364
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,633
Oh, dang.

365
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:03,675

-Oh, come on.
-[Miles] Uh-oh.

369
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,266
-This has been fun.
-Who you talking to?

370
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:14,645
-But I really gotta wrap this up.
-Are you gonna be a while? 'Cause--

495

No, no, no. That's too far.

505

New Jersey's too far from New York?

506
00:29:07,206 --> 00:29:09,541
There's great schools in Brooklyn.

507
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:12,336

I don't know what any of that means.

512
00:29:20,594 --> 00:29:23,722
I could help figure out
how to travel to other dimensions.

513
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:26,558
-Yeah, okay.
-That sounds like a really good fake job.

514
00:29:26,642 --> 00:29:30,229
Dad, when you were my age,
you followed your dream

515
00:29:30,312 --> 00:29:33,690
and went out on your own
to start a business with Uncle Aaron.

516
00:29:33,774 --> 00:29:36,151
-Right?
-That's different. We used to--

517
00:29:36,235 --> 00:29:39,613
See, when you were born-- [laughs]
Plus, your mom used to--

518
00:29:40,239 --> 00:29:41,990
Look, life is a journey.

519
00:29:42,074 --> 00:29:45,994
You all got me into this school because
you thought I could do something special.

520
00:29:46,078 --> 00:29:49,081
-[dramatic, pensive music playing]
-And now I think so too.

521
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:51,667
And the special thing I wanna do is this.

522
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:54,086
There are people out there

523
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:56,797
who can literally teach me
the things I wanna learn.

524
00:29:57,464 --> 00:29:59,383
But they aren't all in Brooklyn.

525
00:30:06,557 --> 00:30:07,808
[fist thumps]

526
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:10,185
That's your story!

527
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:12,145
Now just stick to the script.

528
00:30:12,229 --> 00:30:13,939
[Jeff] Miles, are you paying attention?

529
00:30:14,022 --> 00:30:15,858
-Miles, pay attention.
-[Spot whoops]

530
00:30:15,941 --> 00:30:18,902
-Ow. That hurt my tailbone.
-[Miles]<i> Are you kidding me?</i>

531
00:30:18,986 --> 00:30:22,239
Ooh. I gotta go. You guys keep talking.
This is all great stuff.

532
00:30:22,322 --> 00:30:24,700
Miles, wait.
Did you order the cake for tonight?

533
00:30:24,783 --> 00:30:28,203
Totally. I'm-- You know, call me--
I gotta go, all right? Bye!

534
00:30:28,287 --> 00:30:30,956
This kid. I swear,
what are we gonna do with him?

535
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,875
[man]
<i>All units, supervillain event in progress.</i>

536
00:30:32,958 --> 00:30:35,210
-I gotta go too.
-What? You're gonna leave too?

537
00:30:35,294 --> 00:30:37,546
He leaves, you leave, everybody leaves.
Why am I here?

538
00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:39,882
I know. I'm so sorry.
But we'll figure it out.

539
00:30:40,966 --> 00:30:41,800
Together.

540
00:30:43,844 --> 00:30:46,805
Wow. Excuse me, I'm so sorry.

541
00:30:46,889 --> 00:30:48,807
-[Ms Weber] He's lying to you.
-Jeff?

542
00:30:48,891 --> 00:30:49,725
Your son.

543
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,728
He's lying. And I think you know it.

544
00:30:54,855 --> 00:30:56,440
How's your essay?

545
00:30:56,523 --> 00:30:59,818
-Marinating. This is part of my process.
-Oh? Oh, really?

546
00:30:59,902 --> 00:31:02,321
-I think your guy got away.
-Thanks, I'm on it.

547
00:31:02,404 --> 00:31:04,114
-You seem really stressed.
-[Miles] I agree.

548
00:31:04,198 --> 00:31:06,909
-You're stretched too thin.
-Yeah, thanks for the tip. [yelps]

549
00:31:06,992 --> 00:31:08,368
-That was bad.
-[Jeff] <i>I know.</i>

550
00:31:08,452 --> 00:31:10,871
-What's really going on with this kid?
-I don't know!

551
00:31:10,954 --> 00:31:12,289
-Oh! Hey!
-[Spot] Boom!

552
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:14,833
-Spider-Man.
-[Miles] Officer Morales! I mean:

553
00:31:14,917 --> 00:31:17,961
-[in deep voice] Officer Morales.
-[Spot] This is not what it looks like.

554
00:31:18,045 --> 00:31:19,463
-Hey! Hey!
-[Spot] Officer--

555
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:21,882
My kid goes here, man!

556
00:31:21,965 --> 00:31:22,883
[Spot] This is fun.

557
00:31:22,966 --> 00:31:26,053
I'm on the PTA. You know how many
lemon bars I gotta bake for that?

558
00:31:26,136 --> 00:31:29,223
-[Spot] You left in the middle of a fight.
-[Miles] I did not. It was at the end.

559
00:31:29,306 --> 00:31:31,808
-[Jeff] Are you serious?
-[Spot] It was inconsiderate, super rude.

560
00:31:31,892 --> 00:31:32,726
And a little cocky.

561
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:35,270
Yeah, you got me agreeing
with the bad guy right now.

562
00:31:35,354 --> 00:31:37,689
[Miles] "Bad guy"?
He's barely a villain of the week.

563
00:31:37,773 --> 00:31:38,774
[Spot] What'd you call me?

564
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:40,275
-You realise I'm right here.
-Come on!

565
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:41,777
-[Miles] Everything...
-[Jeff yells]

566
00:31:42,694 --> 00:31:43,695
...is under control.

567
00:31:43,779 --> 00:31:45,405
[lively music playing]

568
00:31:47,783 --> 00:31:49,368
-[Jeff groans] Unbelievable.
-[Spot] Wow.

569
00:31:50,285 --> 00:31:51,995
Of course we'd end up back here.

570
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:53,705
[Jeff] You know, you are just like my son.

571
00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:58,126
[Miles] I am? I-- [laughs]
That's so silly. Imagine that.

572
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:00,629
-[Spot] Back where it all started!
-[Miles] Look out!

573
00:32:00,712 --> 00:32:02,631
[dramatic music playing]

574
00:32:02,714 --> 00:32:04,883
[Spot] The crucible of our connection!

575
00:32:05,926 --> 00:32:08,053
[Miles]
Don't try to wow me with big words.

576
00:32:08,136 --> 00:32:10,180
I do the crossword every day.

577
00:32:16,478 --> 00:32:18,856
-[Spot] Is it all coming back to you?
-[Miles] What are you talking about?

578
00:32:18,939 --> 00:32:20,065
[Spot] The creation event.

579
00:32:20,607 --> 00:32:21,608
[Miles] What?

580
00:32:22,651 --> 00:32:23,819
-[cell phone ringing]
-Ah!

581
00:32:24,611 --> 00:32:26,530
-Yeah.
-Hey, we got cut off.

582
00:32:26,613 --> 00:32:30,117
<i>This is our son we're talking about.
Nothing is more important than family.</i>

583
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,994
[suspenseful music playing]

584
00:32:32,578 --> 00:32:36,456
[Jeff yells, then grunts]
I'm kind of in the middle of something.

585
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:39,459
[Spot grunts] Destiny brought us here.

586
00:32:39,543 --> 00:32:42,421
-You see now, don't you?
-I really don't.

587
00:32:42,504 --> 00:32:44,339
[Spot] I am your nemesis.

588
00:32:44,423 --> 00:32:45,883
Dude, you are not.

589
00:32:45,966 --> 00:32:49,344
You missed.
You can't contain the Spot. Ow!

590
00:32:49,428 --> 00:32:52,055
You really don't remember
what you did to me?

591
00:32:52,556 --> 00:32:55,017
-What I did for you?
-[Miles] Uh... No.

592
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,560
[Spot] I worked at Alchemax.

593
00:32:56,643 --> 00:32:58,854
<i>I ran a test on this collider</i>

594
00:32:58,937 --> 00:33:02,065
<i>that brought a spider here
from another dimension.</i>

595
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:04,526
-Forty-two.
-[man] <i>Its home dimension.</i>

596
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:06,904
[Spot] <i>It escaped. And it bit you.</i>

597
00:33:08,405 --> 00:33:11,950
My spider made you Spider-Man.

598
00:33:12,034 --> 00:33:14,328
-What?
-You ran through the cafeteria.

599
00:33:14,411 --> 00:33:16,413
-He took a bagel!
-You hit me with a bagel.

600
00:33:16,955 --> 00:33:17,831
[yells]

601
00:33:17,915 --> 00:33:20,751
I've hit a lot of different villains
with a lot of different food.

602
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:23,795
[Spot]
You make your flippy, little sassy jokes,

603
00:33:23,879 --> 00:33:24,880
and everyone loves them.

604
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:29,843
But no one knows what it feels like
to be on the other side of them.

605
00:33:29,927 --> 00:33:31,929
[in deep voice]
I'm just trying to lighten the mood.

606
00:33:32,012 --> 00:33:32,930
I created you.

607
00:33:33,764 --> 00:33:35,182
You created me.

608
00:33:35,265 --> 00:33:36,892
Spider-Man, why did you create that guy?

609
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:38,685
I didn't. He's talking crazy.

610
00:33:38,769 --> 00:33:41,605
I was in this collider room
when you blew it up!

611
00:33:41,688 --> 00:33:44,691
[dramatic music playing]

612
00:33:48,028 --> 00:33:49,279
[past Spot screaming]

613
00:33:50,447 --> 00:33:51,448
[Spot] <i>Because of you...</i>

614
00:33:52,282 --> 00:33:55,244
<i>I lost my job, my life,</i>

615
00:33:55,827 --> 00:33:57,162
<i>my face!</i>

616
00:33:57,246 --> 00:33:59,248
<i>My family won't even look at me.</i>

617
00:33:59,331 --> 00:34:00,707
I made you into a hero.

618
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:02,960
You made me into this!

619
00:34:03,043 --> 00:34:06,421
Look at me! You did this to me!

620
00:34:06,505 --> 00:34:09,382
Look at me! I'll make you respect me!

621
00:34:09,466 --> 00:34:11,176
[yelps] Ah! Ow!

622
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,302
[grunts]

623
00:34:13,262 --> 00:34:14,804
I am your neme--

624
00:34:19,976 --> 00:34:21,520
Well, where'd he go?

625
00:34:21,603 --> 00:34:24,063
He kicked his own butt.

626
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,609
[Jeff] You know we're supposed
to catch the bad guys, right?

627
00:34:27,693 --> 00:34:29,277
[Miles] I always do.

628
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,321
-Usually.
-[siren wailing]

629
00:34:31,405 --> 00:34:33,614
-Gutierrez! Get the crane, man.
-[Gutierrez] Yes, sir!

630
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:35,909
[Jeff groans]
This here is why nobody likes us, man.

631
00:34:35,993 --> 00:34:39,246
-[Miles] "Us"?
-I am trying to do right out here.

632
00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:41,956
-I'm trying too.
-You need to be a better role model.

633
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,375
I'm a great role model.

634
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:45,252
[siren wails, then stops]

635
00:34:47,462 --> 00:34:50,007
Hey, Gutierrez, you can cancel the crane.

636
00:34:52,926 --> 00:34:54,511
I swear, I'll quit my job!

637
00:34:54,594 --> 00:34:56,804
[pensive, poignant music playing]

638
00:34:56,889 --> 00:35:00,309
-Do you wanna talk about it?
-Are you crazy?!

639
00:35:00,392 --> 00:35:03,478
Well, men of your generation
ignore their mental health too long.

640
00:35:03,562 --> 00:35:05,063
[Jeff] Oh, boy.

641
00:35:05,147 --> 00:35:07,065
What am I even doing?

642
00:35:07,149 --> 00:35:09,776
'Cause no matter what I do,
someone always thinks I'm blowing it.

643
00:35:11,904 --> 00:35:13,030
[Miles] I know the feeling.

644
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:18,410
So your son.

645
00:35:18,493 --> 00:35:21,705
How's he doing?
You think he's gonna figure it all out?

646
00:35:22,956 --> 00:35:25,209
-Honestly?
-Yeah.

647
00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:27,002
-He's a good kid.
-Yeah?

648
00:35:27,085 --> 00:35:29,505
It's scary.
He says these things that are so smart.

649
00:35:29,588 --> 00:35:31,465
Cool. Well, I should probably--

650
00:35:31,548 --> 00:35:34,676
And then he does these things
that are so stupid.

651
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,721
I just don't want him to mess it up.

652
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:39,848
Maybe get off the kid's ass.

653
00:35:39,932 --> 00:35:43,060
-I'm sorry, what?
-What? What? I don't know.

654
00:35:43,685 --> 00:35:46,396
And I hate
that he's not being honest with me.

655
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,023
Maybe he's scared to talk to you.

656
00:35:48,106 --> 00:35:50,692
Why would anyone be scared to talk to me?

657
00:35:50,776 --> 00:35:52,694
I don't-- I don't know.

658
00:35:52,778 --> 00:35:55,572
It's just-- You think you're getting
pretty good at being a parent.

659
00:35:55,656 --> 00:35:57,449
You think you got it licked.

660
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,035
And then they go and grow up.

661
00:36:01,954 --> 00:36:04,706
I just don't wanna lose him, you know?

662
00:36:12,339 --> 00:36:16,885
Well, as an objective observer
with no skin in the game,

663
00:36:17,845 --> 00:36:21,765
I say you gotta let him
spread his wings, man.

664
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:24,685
-Like this.
-Yeah.

665
00:36:27,396 --> 00:36:28,230
I don't know.

666
00:36:32,109 --> 00:36:34,862
If this isn't nice, what is?

667
00:36:41,535 --> 00:36:42,536
I should go.

668
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:46,081
Yeah, and catch that holes guy.

669
00:36:46,164 --> 00:36:49,543
Don't worry. I don't think
that guy's gonna show his face again.

670
00:36:50,502 --> 00:36:51,336
[Spot] What?

671
00:36:52,254 --> 00:36:53,088
Okay.

672
00:36:54,923 --> 00:36:56,884
I think I kicked myself...

673
00:36:56,967 --> 00:36:58,427
into myself.

674
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,512
[enchanting, pensive music playing]

675
00:37:00,596 --> 00:37:02,222
Well, this is new.

676
00:37:02,306 --> 00:37:05,309

00:44:55,487 --> 00:44:56,363
[sighs]

844
00:44:57,906 --> 00:44:59,157
Two months.

845
00:45:00,742 --> 00:45:02,911
I'm Spider-Man. I'm not grounded.

846
00:45:55,464 --> 00:45:56,298
[Gwen] Miles!

847
00:45:57,132 --> 00:45:57,966
Miles!

848
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,968
You got a minute?

849
00:46:00,052 --> 00:46:01,220
Oh! Whoa!

850
00:46:01,303 --> 00:46:03,305
-[chuckles]
-How did you get--?

851
00:46:05,265 --> 00:46:07,226
How did you get--? How have you been?

852
00:46:07,309 --> 00:46:08,769
Uh, I've been good.

853
00:46:08,852 --> 00:46:11,396
I've been-- Yeah, just great. Look at you.

854
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,065
You, uh-- You grew, huh?

855
00:46:13,148 --> 00:46:17,861
-Had a little growth spurt?
-Uh, yeah. Your hair has gotten pinker.

856
00:46:17,945 --> 00:46:20,572
-Is this the room you grew up in?
-It is. Um...

857
00:46:20,656 --> 00:46:23,867
-[lilting, pensive music playing]
-But my dorm room is very adult.

858
00:46:23,951 --> 00:46:26,495
Cool. Yeah, no, I used to play with these
when I was younger too.

859
00:46:26,578 --> 00:46:29,081
-Uh, that's a collectible.
-I used to have this one.

860
00:46:29,164 --> 00:46:32,793
-An extremely rare, highly sought--
-Why is it still in the package?

861
00:46:32,876 --> 00:46:34,962
Eee! Um... [laughs]

862
00:46:35,587 --> 00:46:37,130
That's fine.

863
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:41,468
-Are these your drawings? They're good.
-Hey. What? No.

864
00:46:43,554 --> 00:46:46,682
[Gwen] Wow, there's so many.

865
00:46:48,141 --> 00:46:49,268
Missed you too.

866
00:46:50,561 --> 00:46:52,896
So, what are you doing here?

867
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:56,650
I mean, I thought I'd never see you again.

868
00:46:58,026 --> 00:46:59,194
Wanna get out of here?

869
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:02,531
I'm grounded.

870
00:47:03,282 --> 00:47:04,116
Bummer.

871
00:47:07,578 --> 00:47:09,496
Is Spider-Man grounded?

872
00:47:10,163 --> 00:47:11,081
Um...

873
00:47:13,041 --> 00:47:14,293
I mean, I...

874
00:47:14,376 --> 00:47:16,503
[dramatic music swelling]

875
00:47:18,422 --> 00:47:19,590
[chuckles]

876
00:47:20,549 --> 00:47:22,092
[Rio] Miles?

877
00:47:22,176 --> 00:47:24,261
Your dad's ready to listen now.

878
00:47:29,641 --> 00:47:31,476
["Mona Lisa" playing]

879
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,478
That's three months!

880
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,440
[Miles] Wait, hold on.

881
00:47:36,523 --> 00:47:40,402
There's an elite society
with all the best Spider-People in it?

882
00:47:40,485 --> 00:47:42,571
-Okay, so there's this lady, Jess Drew.
-Uh-huh?

883
00:47:42,654 --> 00:47:44,072
-She rides a motorcycle.
-Motorcycle?

884
00:47:44,156 --> 00:47:45,782
Oh, my gosh,
I'm learning so much from her.

885
00:47:45,866 --> 00:47:47,784
Oh, yeah. I've learned a lot of stuff too.

886
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:50,579
I've levelled up my whole thing. See?

887
00:47:50,662 --> 00:47:51,747
-[Gwen] Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

888
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:53,498
-[Gwen] Let's see it, then.
-Let's go.

889
00:47:53,582 --> 00:47:54,583
[Gwen] Thread the needle.

890
00:47:57,669 --> 00:47:58,712
[truck horn blaring]

891
00:47:58,795 --> 00:47:59,630
Whoa!

892
00:48:00,339 --> 00:48:02,257
[yelling]

893
00:48:03,133 --> 00:48:03,967
Easy.

894
00:48:04,718 --> 00:48:05,677
[Gwen] And Miguel.

895
00:48:05,761 --> 00:48:07,638
-The whole thing was his idea.
-[Miles] Right.

896
00:48:07,721 --> 00:48:09,640
And who's Miguel?

897
00:48:09,723 --> 00:48:13,185
[Gwen] Oh, he's like a
ninja-vampire-Spider-Man but a good guy.

898
00:48:13,268 --> 00:48:16,104
[Miles] A vampire good guy.
I'd pay good money to see that.

899
00:48:16,188 --> 00:48:20,234
-So how long ago did they invite you?
-Only like a few months ago.

900
00:48:20,317 --> 00:48:24,112
-"Months" is kind of a long time.
-[Gwen] Okay, this one counts for two.

901
00:48:28,158 --> 00:48:29,076
[Miles whoops]

902
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:30,827
Ha, ha!

903
00:48:30,911 --> 00:48:31,912
Look at you.

904
00:48:32,538 --> 00:48:33,580
Look at me.

905
00:48:35,374 --> 00:48:36,625
[Miles] Keep the change.

906
00:48:36,708 --> 00:48:38,544
-So this club.
-Look at that dum-dum.

907
00:48:38,627 --> 00:48:40,087
[Miles] What kind of stuff do you do?

908
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:41,713
[Gwen] Guy in the stripes, ten points.

909
00:48:41,797 --> 00:48:43,882
We're trying to keep the multiverse
from collapsing.

910
00:48:43,966 --> 00:48:45,467
[Miles] I thought we did that already.

911
00:48:45,551 --> 00:48:48,387
[Gwen] Like, last week we had this mission
to some Shakespeare dimension.

912
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:50,138
-[Miles] What?
-And Hobie and I just, like--

913
00:48:50,222 --> 00:48:52,891
-[Miles] Who's Hobie?
-[Gwen] Oh, my gosh, you would love him.

914
00:48:52,975 --> 00:48:55,018
He lets me crash
in his dimension sometimes.

915
00:48:55,102 --> 00:48:57,312
[Miles] What does that mean,
you stay overnight or...?

916
00:48:57,396 --> 00:49:00,274
[Gwen] Anyway, they're pretty strict
about where I go,

917
00:49:00,357 --> 00:49:02,401
or I really would have come
to see you sooner.

918
00:49:02,484 --> 00:49:05,737
Right. So, uh-- So why'd you come now?

919
00:49:06,446 --> 00:49:08,156
Don't do that. [yelps]

920
00:49:11,034 --> 00:49:13,078
Hey, Gw-- Uh, Gwen?

921
00:49:14,037 --> 00:49:15,080
Where'd you go?

922
00:49:16,373 --> 00:49:18,083
[siren wailing]

923
00:49:18,166 --> 00:49:19,459
Where did she go?

924
00:49:25,674 --> 00:49:27,676
[beeping]

925
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,515
-[Gwen] Ah!
-Oh, hey. There you are.

926
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:35,350
-What were you doing?
-Waiting for you.

No, it's not the Greek burger place.

[Gwen laughs]

931
00:49:52,326 --> 00:49:54,536
-This is a cool thinking spot.
-[Miles] Right?

932
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:58,624
Who needs a treadmill when you have
the Williamsburgh Bank Building?

933
00:49:58,707 --> 00:49:59,708
[Gwen laughs]

934

-["Another Dimension" playing]
-So, uh, you and your dad.

935
00:50:04,546 --> 00:50:05,714
You still haven't talked?

936
00:50:06,381 --> 00:50:09,218
What exactly would we talk about?

937
00:50:09,301 --> 00:50:11,678
"Hey, Dad, how have
the last few months been?

938
00:50:12,471 --> 00:50:14,515
You still think
I murdered my best friend?"

939
00:50:17,226 --> 00:50:18,227
I don't know.

940
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:21,104
I mean, my parents--
I mean, maybe if I told them--

941
00:50:21,188 --> 00:50:22,022
Don't.

942
00:50:22,814 --> 00:50:24,233
Trust me on that.

943
00:50:40,666 --> 00:50:41,708
Well...

944
00:50:43,293 --> 00:50:46,129
Maybe some things
are supposed to be just for us.

945
00:50:47,965 --> 00:50:48,799
[Gwen] Hm.

946
00:50:50,467 --> 00:50:52,344
That's a nice way to think about it.

947
00:50:53,762 --> 00:50:57,057
I'm just a really
emotionally intelligent guy.

It really is always so great
to talk to you.

00:51:05,065 --> 00:51:06,900
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

952
00:51:08,861 --> 00:51:12,197
I mean, how many people
can you talk to about this stuff?

953
00:51:13,448 --> 00:51:14,658
You don't even know.

What?

956

You're the only friend
I've ever really made after Peter died.

957
00:51:26,628 --> 00:51:29,256
Other than Hobie, right?

958
00:51:30,841 --> 00:51:33,594
-That's different.
-Yeah? How's that?

959

I don't know.

We're the same.

I could come with you.

-I did save the multiverse.

I have, like, electric powers.

-There aren't a lot of slots.
-Think about it.

Ah, right.

00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,618
Look, if it was up to me, you--

985
00:53:21,702 --> 00:53:23,245
I know. I know, I know.

986
00:53:25,873 --> 00:53:26,874
Oh, no. No, no.

00:53:26,957 --> 00:53:29,459
-Don't do that. Miles!
-All right.

988

-It's, uh, really delicate.
-Geez.

989
00:53:32,504 --> 00:53:35,382
Sorry. I didn't mean to, um, snap.

Okay. All right. I'm sorry.

-I'm Miles's mom.

You're using my first name. Okay.

This is nice.
We found it in Miles's room, so...

-I guess you must've been there, huh?
-And you must be Jeff.

997

She called me Jeff.
That's very sweet. "Jeff."

998
00:53:55,152 --> 00:53:56,987
You must mean Lieutenant Morales.

Soon to be Captain Morales.

1000
00:53:59,656 --> 00:54:01,033
Ah! Captain.

1001
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:05,495
Gwanda and I are friends from school.

1002
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:08,165
-Yeah, we were just catching up.
-Oh...

1003
00:54:08,248 --> 00:54:09,499
Don't take him from me.

00:54:10,501 --> 00:54:13,712
[laughing] I'm just kidding.
He's grounded, so you can't.

1006
00:54:13,795 --> 00:54:15,130
-Don't break his heart.
-Mom!

00:54:17,716 --> 00:54:20,469
-Really?
-Yeah, I forgot to get my steps in.

1009
00:54:20,552 --> 00:54:22,971
[laughs nervously]
Really, really wish I could stay longer.

1010
00:54:23,055 --> 00:54:24,389
I'm sorry.

01:06:00,043 --> 01:06:01,420
[Pav] Hey, who's the new guy?

1182
01:06:01,503 --> 01:06:04,381
Hey, Pav.
He's Miles and he wasn't invited.

1183
01:06:04,464 --> 01:06:07,050
[Pav] Oh!
You weren't invited and you came anyway?

1184
01:06:07,134 --> 01:06:09,720
-Right?
-New guy must be in love with you.

1185
01:06:09,803 --> 01:06:10,846
-[Gwen] Okay, whoa.
-[Miles] No.

1186
01:06:10,929 --> 01:06:13,015
-I'm not.
-I'm very good at reading people.

1187
01:06:13,098 --> 01:06:14,474
-[Gwen] He's not.
-[Miles] Who are you?

1188
01:06:14,558 --> 01:06:16,185
-[Pav] Glad you asked, new guy.
-I'm not a new guy.

1191
01:06:21,899 --> 01:06:24,818
-Yeah, uh...

1192
01:06:24,902 --> 01:06:26,111
<i>I wake up, skip the workout,</i>

1193
01:06:26,195 --> 01:06:28,864

and I don't wanna get too big.</i>

1194

1195

You don't use any product at all?

1196
01:06:32,201 --> 01:06:33,911
Just coconut oil, prayer, some genetics.

-I love chai tea.
-What did you just say?

1201
01:06:43,587 --> 01:06:44,546
"Chai tea"?

1202
01:06:44,630 --> 01:06:47,758
"Chai" means "tea," bro.
You're saying "tea" tea.

1203
01:06:47,841 --> 01:06:50,302
Would I ask you for a "coffee" coffee
with "cream" cream?

1204
01:06:50,385 --> 01:06:51,220
I'm so sorry.

1205

01:06:58,936 --> 01:07:01,063
Hello, Police Inspector Singh.

1209
01:07:01,146 --> 01:07:03,148
This is your daughter. I do not know her.

1210
01:07:03,232 --> 01:07:07,319
To top it off, I live in the best possible
Spider-Man city, Mumbattan.

1211
01:07:07,402 --> 01:07:10,447
Quick tour. This is where the traffic is,
this is where the traffic is.

1212
01:07:10,531 --> 01:07:13,951
Traffic here too. This is where
the British stole all of our stuff. Whoa!

1213
01:07:16,828 --> 01:07:18,121
-[Spot] Hello, Spider-Man.
-[Gwen] Hi.

1214
01:07:18,205 --> 01:07:19,623
-[Pav] Hey.
-[Spot] Not you.

1215
01:07:19,706 --> 01:07:21,083
[Gwen] You talking to him or me or him?

1216
01:07:21,166 --> 01:07:22,876
-[Miles] Think he means me.
-[Spot] Yeah. Him.

1217
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:24,628
[Miles] I got this, guys.

1218
01:07:24,711 --> 01:07:26,255
-Huh?
-Wow. How are you?

1219
01:07:26,338 --> 01:07:29,758
-[dramatic music playing]
-Can you tell I levelled up my game?

1220
01:07:29,842 --> 01:07:32,219
I'm on a journey of self-improvement.

1221
01:07:32,302 --> 01:07:33,971
[Pav] And you came to India.

1222
01:07:34,054 --> 01:07:37,474
That's a Western culture cliché.
Don't <i>Eat, Pray, Love </i>me, bro.

1223
01:07:37,558 --> 01:07:38,892
I did not mean it like that.

1224
01:07:38,976 --> 01:07:41,520
Let me guess, you're gonna ask me
about saffron and cardamom

1225
01:07:41,603 --> 01:07:44,064
and naan bread,
which is the same as saying "bread" bread,

1226
01:07:44,147 --> 01:07:45,816
which is the same as saying "chai tea."

1227
01:07:45,899 --> 01:07:47,860
-[Spot] Oh, I love chai tea.
-[Pav] No!

1228
01:07:49,278 --> 01:07:52,781
[Miles] Come on, man! I think maybe
we got off on the wrong foot.

1229
01:07:52,865 --> 01:07:54,074
Let's just talk about this.

1230
01:07:54,157 --> 01:07:57,744
Fine. You made me feel empty,
like I had a hole inside of me.

1231
01:07:57,828 --> 01:07:58,954
[Spot] We all have holes.

1232
01:07:59,788 --> 01:08:02,749
But now I found out
what to fill that hole up with.

1233
01:08:02,833 --> 01:08:04,168
More holes!

1234
01:08:04,251 --> 01:08:06,003
[Miles] That doesn't make any sense!

1235
01:08:06,086 --> 01:08:07,045
[Spot] It will.

1236
01:08:07,713 --> 01:08:09,131
I'm okay. I'm good.

1237
01:08:09,214 --> 01:08:10,632
-Don't worry.
-[Gwen] We won't.

1238
01:08:10,716 --> 01:08:12,718
This romantic tension is so palpable.

1239
01:08:12,801 --> 01:08:14,178
If Spot gets more holes...

1240
01:08:14,261 --> 01:08:16,470
-[Pav] Will they, won't they?
-...he'll be unstoppable!

1241
01:08:16,555 --> 01:08:18,307
-We can't let him get to--
-[Gwen] Alchemax?

1242
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:20,809
[Pav]
See? How can you guys even concentrate?

Go away. Go away.
See you later. Thanks for coming.

1249
01:08:37,033 --> 01:08:39,703
[Pav] Would you please deactivate
this strong barrier?

Oh, I have so many, but none for this.

Do you want us to do something,
or do we just stand here?

Are you charging it, or--?

1267

No. I'm absorbing it
so I can shoot it back.

-What's this dude saying?

1277

[Pav] It's English for "We get
along great, and we're close friends."

Hobie, thanks for breaking the shield!

-Then why are you here?
-Looking out for my drummer, is all.

1506
01:23:21,168 --> 01:23:22,878
I want to be in a band. I--

1507
01:23:22,961 --> 01:23:26,507
I wanna see my friends,
and I need a watch to do that.

1508
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:27,925
Guys, come on.

1509
01:23:28,008 --> 01:23:29,510
All right. Squashed.

1510
01:23:31,011 --> 01:23:33,263
Don't enlist till you know
what war you're fighting.

1511
01:23:56,703 --> 01:23:58,080
[whispers] Yeah, I know it's slow.

1512
01:23:58,622 --> 01:23:59,998
But it's his thing.

1513
01:24:01,583 --> 01:24:04,753
[in normal voice]
Miguel O'Hara, meet Miles Morales.

1514
01:24:04,837 --> 01:24:07,130
Hey! [speaks in Spanish]

1515
01:24:07,214 --> 01:24:08,507
[in English] I speak Spanish.

1516
01:24:09,925 --> 01:24:11,260
[speaks in Spanish]

1517
01:24:13,011 --> 01:24:14,012
[speaks in Spanish]

1518
01:24:17,766 --> 01:24:20,310
-[in English] I'm excited to get going.
-[in English] Oh. Great.

1519
01:24:20,394 --> 01:24:22,563
-I have new ideas on how to catch Spot.
-Oh. Wow. Uh-huh.

1520
01:24:22,646 --> 01:24:25,482
[Miles] He just wants to be
taken seriously, like we all do. Whoa!

1521
01:24:25,774 --> 01:24:27,192
He's worried about Spot.

1522
01:24:27,276 --> 01:24:28,610
I'll worry about Spot!

1523
01:24:28,694 --> 01:24:31,613
-What did I do?
-Miguel! It's not his fault.

1524
01:24:31,697 --> 01:24:34,199
-Fault? Hold up.
-You blew another hole in the multiverse!

1525
01:24:34,283 --> 01:24:37,744
-He doesn't know any better.
-I do know what-- Not know what?

1526
01:24:37,828 --> 01:24:39,329
But you did, Gwen.

1527
01:24:40,038 --> 01:24:42,958
And you--
I'm just gonna try to ignore you.

1528
01:24:43,041 --> 01:24:45,002
-I just can't. I can't even.
-I ain't even here.

1529
01:24:45,836 --> 01:24:46,879
Or here.

1530
01:24:46,962 --> 01:24:49,464
-What's happening?
-[Peter] Hey, Miguel!

1531
01:24:49,548 --> 01:24:52,092
Come on, go easy on the kid.

1532
01:24:52,176 --> 01:24:55,554
-He had a terrible teacher.
-[uplifting music playing]

1533
01:24:55,637 --> 01:24:57,055
He had no chance.

1534
01:24:57,139 --> 01:24:58,891
-Peter!
-Oh, boy.

1535
01:24:58,974 --> 01:25:01,435
Humbling-Reality Spider-Man has arrived.

1536
01:25:01,518 --> 01:25:02,936
-Miles!
-Dude!

1537
01:25:03,020 --> 01:25:06,732
Don't be afraid of my friend Miguel.
He just looks scary. He's got no bite.

1538
01:25:06,815 --> 01:25:09,193
-[groans] Peter.
-You're growing up on me. You look great.

1539
01:25:09,276 --> 01:25:12,905
-You look solid, you know. You look good.
-Define "solid."

1540
01:25:12,988 --> 01:25:14,948
What happened?
You bleeding from the armpits?

1541
01:25:15,032 --> 01:25:17,618
-Peter, you--
-Don't worry, we'll get you a new suit.

1542
01:25:17,701 --> 01:25:19,369
Peter, you gotta tell them--

1543
01:25:19,453 --> 01:25:21,872
-Wait. What is that?
-[Peter] Mayday!

1544
01:25:21,955 --> 01:25:23,332
-You have a baby!
-I have a baby.

1545
01:25:23,415 --> 01:25:24,416
This is crazy.

1546
01:25:24,499 --> 01:25:26,877
Don't forget to keep
your little day pass on, honey.

1547
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:29,671
Oh, you have one too.
I didn't know they made those for adults.

1548
01:25:29,755 --> 01:25:32,841
-Give me a second. Mayday!
-The kid's an anarchist.

1549
01:25:32,925 --> 01:25:35,427
I'm coming up to get you.
Here I come. Don't move.

1550
01:25:35,511 --> 01:25:37,095
[grumbling in Spanish]

1551
01:25:37,179 --> 01:25:40,599
I got you. I knew I was gonna regret
making her that web shooter.

1552
01:25:40,682 --> 01:25:42,684
I shouldn't have done it.
That's an actual mistake.

1553
01:25:43,810 --> 01:25:45,646
-You wanna see pictures?
-She's right there.

1554
01:25:45,729 --> 01:25:48,065
-Look at this pic!
-Oh, you've got them.

1555
01:25:48,148 --> 01:25:49,525
-She's incredible.
-Yup.

1556
01:25:49,608 --> 01:25:52,361
This is her funny face.
That's her mad face.

1557
01:25:52,444 --> 01:25:54,238
This one is the studious one.

1558
01:25:54,321 --> 01:25:56,990
Watch out,
the next one you're gonna crack up.

1559
01:25:57,074 --> 01:26:00,035
Miguel's gonna die.
Miguel, look at this one.

1560
01:26:00,118 --> 01:26:02,120
I'm trying to hold
a serious adult conversation.

1561
01:26:02,204 --> 01:26:03,997
You're the only Spider-Man
who isn't funny.

1562
01:26:04,081 --> 01:26:06,542
-We're supposed to be funny.
-The fate of the multiverse--

1563
01:26:06,625 --> 01:26:08,335
You always lose me with that.

1564
01:26:08,418 --> 01:26:12,589
You say, "The fate of the multiverse,"
and my brain dies.

1565
01:26:14,174 --> 01:26:15,843
Do you guys smell that?
Mayday took a crap.

1566
01:26:15,926 --> 01:26:17,386
-Yup. She's a Parker.
-[Miguel] Miles.

1567
01:26:17,469 --> 01:26:19,179
That's what happens
when a Parker eats an avocado.

1568
01:26:19,263 --> 01:26:21,306
-You disrupted a canon event.
-Canon event?

1569
01:26:21,390 --> 01:26:24,268
The kid wasn't thinking.
That's not how he works.

1570
01:26:24,351 --> 01:26:25,394
That's insulting.

1571
01:26:25,477 --> 01:26:28,105
Taking a crap on the establishment.
I salute you.

1572
01:26:28,188 --> 01:26:30,649
Wait, what are you upset about?
I saved those people.

1573
01:26:30,732 --> 01:26:32,276
And that's the problem.

1574
01:26:32,359 --> 01:26:34,236
[ominous music playing]

1575
01:26:34,319 --> 01:26:37,197
-LYLA, do the thing.
<i>-Huh? What thing?</i>

1576
01:26:37,281 --> 01:26:40,117
What do you mean, "What thing?"
The information-explainy thing.

1577
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:41,201
<i>Okay.</i>

1578
01:26:47,624 --> 01:26:48,917
What's this?

1579
01:26:49,793 --> 01:26:52,379
This is everything.

1580
01:26:52,462 --> 01:26:55,465
[dramatic music playing]

1581
01:26:57,801 --> 01:26:59,803
Can you be more specific?

1582
01:26:59,887 --> 01:27:02,139
Can you not talk for a second?

1583
01:27:02,222 --> 01:27:03,307
[Miles] Yeah, yeah, I--

1584
01:27:04,266 --> 01:27:05,309
[Miguel] And this here?

1585
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:07,811
This is all of us.

1586
01:27:08,645 --> 01:27:11,690
All of our lives woven together

1587
01:27:11,773 --> 01:27:14,776
in a beautiful web of life and destiny.

1588
01:27:15,819 --> 01:27:17,154
The Spider-Verse.

1589
01:27:17,237 --> 01:27:18,280
Spider-Verse.

1590
01:27:19,198 --> 01:27:20,908
That's stupid.

1591
01:27:21,950 --> 01:27:24,411
It's called
the Arachnohumanoid Polymultiverse.

1592
01:27:25,329 --> 01:27:28,373
Which sounds stupid too, I guess.

1593
01:27:29,541 --> 01:27:32,127
And these nodes where the lines converge?

1594
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:34,338
[Miguel] They are the canon.

1595
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:39,051
Chapters that are a part
of every Spider's story every time.

1596
01:27:40,010 --> 01:27:41,053
Some good.

1597
01:27:42,596 --> 01:27:43,805
Some bad.

1598
01:27:46,016 --> 01:27:47,017
Some very bad.

1599
01:27:55,317 --> 01:27:56,610
Just keep going.

1600
01:27:56,693 --> 01:27:58,153
Uncle Aaron.

1601
01:27:59,029 --> 01:28:01,990
This one, Event ASM-90.

1602
01:28:02,699 --> 01:28:05,369
A police captain close to Spider-Man dies,

1603
01:28:05,452 --> 01:28:09,706
saving a kid from falling rubble
during a battle with an archnemesis.

1604
01:28:10,332 --> 01:28:11,500
Captain Stacy.

1605
01:28:12,584 --> 01:28:13,877
I'm so sorry.

1606
01:28:24,847 --> 01:28:25,681
No.

1607
01:28:37,150 --> 01:28:38,652
That happened to you?

1608
01:28:40,654 --> 01:28:42,114
And me.

1609
01:28:45,909 --> 01:28:47,661
Ey. What of it?

1610
01:28:48,287 --> 01:28:50,664
[Miguel]
That's how the story is supposed to go.

1611
01:28:51,623 --> 01:28:56,044
Canon events are the connections
that bind our lives together.

1612
01:28:56,795 --> 01:28:59,339
But those connections can be broken.

1613
01:29:00,674 --> 01:29:05,095
That's why anomalies are so dangerous.

1614
01:29:06,263 --> 01:29:08,891
Inspector Singh's death was a canon event.

1615
01:29:08,974 --> 01:29:10,934
You weren't supposed to be there.

1616
01:29:11,018 --> 01:29:13,478
And you weren't supposed to save him.

1617
01:29:14,062 --> 01:29:16,940
-That's why Gwen tried to stop you.
-[Gwen] Miles!

1618
01:29:17,024 --> 01:29:19,234
I thought you were trying to save me.

1619
01:29:20,903 --> 01:29:22,404
I was. I...

1620
01:29:23,822 --> 01:29:25,324
I was doing both.

1621
01:29:25,949 --> 01:29:30,412
And now, Miles,
because you changed the story,

1622
01:29:30,495 --> 01:29:33,165
Pavitr's dimension is unravelling.

1623
01:29:33,874 --> 01:29:36,502
If we're lucky, we can stop it.

1624
01:29:38,086 --> 01:29:39,796
We haven't always been lucky.

1625
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:42,049
That wasn't me. That was the Spot.

1626
01:29:42,132 --> 01:29:44,801
It's what happens
when you break the canon.

1627
01:29:47,221 --> 01:29:48,305
[Miles] How do you know?

1628
01:29:49,181 --> 01:29:51,391
Because I broke it once myself.

1629
01:29:52,309 --> 01:29:55,854
I found a world where I had a family.

1630
01:29:55,938 --> 01:29:57,314
<i>Where I was happy.</i>

1631
01:29:58,273 --> 01:30:00,192
<i>At least, a version of me was.</i>

1632
01:30:01,652 --> 01:30:04,446
{\an8}<i>And that version of myself was killed.</i>

1633
01:30:09,701 --> 01:30:10,994
<i>So I replaced him.</i>

1634
01:30:14,498 --> 01:30:16,416
<i>I thought it was harmless.</i>

1635
01:30:19,545 --> 01:30:20,963
<i>But I was wrong.</i>

1636
01:30:21,839 --> 01:30:23,924
[people screaming]

1637
01:30:24,007 --> 01:30:26,718
[poignant, dramatic music playing]

1638
01:30:30,013 --> 01:30:31,849
Daddy? Dad.

1639
01:30:31,932 --> 01:30:33,100
Daddy, no!

1640
01:30:38,230 --> 01:30:39,648
[Miguel] <i>Isn't that right, Peter?</i>

1641
01:30:40,691 --> 01:30:41,525
Yeah.

1642
01:30:42,150 --> 01:30:45,362
You break enough canon,
save enough captains...

1643
01:30:47,489 --> 01:30:49,700
and we could lose everything.

1644
01:31:01,753 --> 01:31:03,922
My dad is about to be captain.

1645
01:31:04,006 --> 01:31:06,175
[ominous music playing]

1646
01:31:13,223 --> 01:31:14,433
No.

1647
01:31:16,685 --> 01:31:18,896
[Spot]
<i>I'm gonna take everything from you...</i>

1648
01:31:20,814 --> 01:31:23,233
<i>-like you took everything from me.
</i>-[Jeff] I'm coming!

1649
01:31:27,946 --> 01:31:29,156
Spot does it.

1650
01:31:31,074 --> 01:31:32,284
He kills him.

1651
01:31:38,707 --> 01:31:41,043
When does it happen?

1652
01:31:44,379 --> 01:31:46,632
-When does it happen?
-In two days.

1653
01:31:47,799 --> 01:31:49,051
When he's sworn in.

1654
01:31:50,260 --> 01:31:52,179
<i>That's what the model says.</i>

1655
01:31:54,181 --> 01:31:55,516
[Miguel] I'm sorry, Miles.

1656
01:31:55,599 --> 01:31:56,767
Send me home.

1657
01:31:57,351 --> 01:31:59,394
I can't do that. Not now.

1658
01:32:00,062 --> 01:32:02,689
What am I supposed to do?
Just let him die?

1659
01:32:06,944 --> 01:32:08,403
What about your dad?

1660
01:32:08,487 --> 01:32:10,072
He's a captain, right?

1661
01:32:12,407 --> 01:32:13,242
Yeah.

1662
01:32:13,825 --> 01:32:15,202
[Miles] And that's it?

1663
01:32:15,285 --> 01:32:16,787
You aren't gonna do anything about it?

1664
01:32:19,831 --> 01:32:21,583
Okay, what about Uncle Ben?

1665
01:32:21,667 --> 01:32:25,754
That have been okay if you knew
and you just let it play out?

1666
01:32:26,463 --> 01:32:28,799
If not for Uncle Ben,

1667
01:32:28,882 --> 01:32:31,552
most of us wouldn't be here, Miles.

1668
01:32:32,511 --> 01:32:35,013
And all the good we did, it...

1669
01:32:35,097 --> 01:32:36,849
It wouldn't have been done.

1670
01:32:40,060 --> 01:32:42,437
So we're just supposed to let people die

1671
01:32:42,521 --> 01:32:45,858
because some algorithm says that
that's supposed to happen?

1672
01:32:45,941 --> 01:32:49,069
You realise how messed up
that sounds, right?

1673
01:32:49,152 --> 01:32:51,905
You have a choice
between saving one person

1674
01:32:51,989 --> 01:32:53,824
and saving an entire world.

1675
01:32:53,907 --> 01:32:54,950
Every world.

1676
01:32:55,033 --> 01:32:57,411
I can do both. Spider-Man always--

1677
01:32:57,494 --> 01:32:58,745
Not always.

1678
01:33:02,291 --> 01:33:05,377
Miles, we all want to live the life
we wish we had.

1679
01:33:06,044 --> 01:33:08,505
Believe me, I have tried.

1680
01:33:08,589 --> 01:33:12,551
And the harder I tried,
the more damage I did.

1681
01:33:14,052 --> 01:33:15,888
You can't have it all, kid.

1682
01:33:20,058 --> 01:33:22,519
Being Spider-Man is a sacrifice.

1683
01:33:23,103 --> 01:33:24,354
That's the job.

1684
01:33:24,438 --> 01:33:26,148
That's what you signed up for.

1685
01:33:27,274 --> 01:33:28,275
[Peni] Miles.

1686
01:33:30,903 --> 01:33:31,945
[Miles] Peni?

1687
01:33:33,113 --> 01:33:34,114
What is this?

1688
01:33:35,908 --> 01:33:37,743
Is this is an intervention or something?

1689
01:33:38,619 --> 01:33:39,745
We know it's hard.

1690
01:33:40,996 --> 01:33:42,456
But it's the truth, Miles.

1691
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:46,752
Is that why you're here?
To let me down easy?

1692
01:33:48,921 --> 01:33:51,298
It worked last time,
why not run it back, huh?

1693
01:33:51,381 --> 01:33:53,383
-Hey, hold on. Hold on.
-You were right, Gwen.

1694
01:33:53,967 --> 01:33:56,803
-You should've never come to see me.
-Kid, look at--

1695
01:33:56,887 --> 01:33:58,222
Stop calling me that.

1696
01:33:58,305 --> 01:33:59,598
-There we go.
-Hobie, not helping.

1697
01:33:59,681 --> 01:34:02,059
-Good.
-Miles, please understand.

1698
01:34:02,142 --> 01:34:04,645
You can't ask me not to save my father.

1699
01:34:04,728 --> 01:34:05,729
I'm not asking.

1700
01:34:06,522 --> 01:34:08,190
Just give him a second, please.

1701
01:34:08,273 --> 01:34:11,276
-This is a great look.
-Don't! Stop it!

1702
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:14,196
If we let him leave, he'll only do
more damage. We both know that.

1703
01:34:14,279 --> 01:34:16,406
Little man. Peter Pan. Palms.

1704
01:34:16,490 --> 01:34:19,701
[Miguel] Just need to hold you a few days.
Sorry it had to end like this, kid.

1705
01:34:19,785 --> 01:34:23,038
I said not to call me that!

1706
01:34:24,998 --> 01:34:27,000

1707
01:34:27,709 --> 01:34:28,544

-[dramatic music playing]
-Miles!

1709
01:34:36,969 --> 01:34:37,970
All right.

1710
01:34:38,053 --> 01:34:40,848
I'm sorry for doing this.
This is bad parenting.

1711
01:34:42,015 --> 01:34:43,684
Just for the record, I quit.

1712

1723

1724
01:35:07,499 --> 01:35:09,376
[Miguel]
Miles! He's right there. He's right in--

-Turn around!

Wow! I guess it can.

-Whoa!
-Sorry!

1731
01:35:50,167 --> 01:35:52,252
And then I looked at my uncle, and...

1732
01:35:52,336 --> 01:35:54,421
Uh, let me guess. He died?

1733
01:36:04,389 --> 01:36:05,432
Whoa!

Hey, Miguel!

-I'm a huge fan of your work.
-Thanks.

1743
01:36:27,371 --> 01:36:30,082
Do you think Spider-People too often use
comedy as a crutch?

1744
01:36:30,165 --> 01:36:32,835
-Uh...
-Get it? "Crutch"?

[Miles screams]

1751
01:37:12,374 --> 01:37:14,793
My bad, everybody.
There was somewhere to run.

1752
01:37:23,635 --> 01:37:26,805
-[Miguel] Stop running!
-Then stop chasing me!

1753
01:37:26,889 --> 01:37:28,849
[Miguel] You're so frustrating.

1754
01:37:28,932 --> 01:37:32,728
I know he's your friend,
but it's the only way.

1755

-But my gut says--
-Then use your head.

01:38:19,775 --> 01:38:22,528
-No, no. Let me go.
-It is crazy to run.

1761
01:38:22,611 --> 01:38:25,280
Running is the least crazy thing going on.

1762
01:38:25,364 --> 01:38:27,658
-Look, I feel bad.
-Good!

1763
01:38:27,741 --> 01:38:30,661
But this is just how stuff works.
You're not gonna win here.

1764
01:38:30,744 --> 01:38:33,372
Just wait, don't move.
Stop moving so fast.

1765
01:38:33,455 --> 01:38:34,456
No!

1766
01:38:34,540 --> 01:38:36,875
-Do you wanna hold my baby?
-What?

1767
01:38:36,959 --> 01:38:39,086
Would you just give the baby one squeeze
and then we'll talk?

1768
01:38:39,169 --> 01:38:41,755
I think it's gonna change our vibe.
It's very rejuvenating.

1769
01:38:41,839 --> 01:38:43,215
I'm plenty juvenated.

1770
01:38:43,298 --> 01:38:46,802
You'll get more so when you go
chest-to-chest with this magical child.

1771
01:38:46,885 --> 01:38:49,221
You don't get to have
a heartfelt conversation with me.

1772
01:38:49,304 --> 01:38:51,431
Just hold the baby,
we'll see what happens!

1773
01:38:51,515 --> 01:38:52,349
[yells]

1774
01:38:53,475 --> 01:38:55,727
You're the reason I had her, okay?

1775
01:38:57,062 --> 01:39:00,649
I thought that if I did
a decent job raising her,

1776
01:39:00,732 --> 01:39:04,403
then there was a chance
she was gonna turn out like you.

1777
01:39:04,486 --> 01:39:07,990
And that got me excited
because you are a wonderful person.

1778
01:39:08,073 --> 01:39:10,826
-And I like being around you.
-[poignant, pensive music playing]

1779
01:39:12,035 --> 01:39:14,079
Then why didn't you come see me?

Bec--

1781
01:39:16,999 --> 01:39:18,166
I couldn't.

1782
01:39:19,042 --> 01:39:21,378
I wanted to be with you guys so badly.

1783
01:39:23,797 --> 01:39:26,008
But this thing
isn't what I thought it was.

1784
01:39:26,091 --> 01:39:29,761
Look, bad things are gonna happen.

1785
01:39:29,845 --> 01:39:32,306
It makes us who we are.

1786
01:39:33,307 --> 01:39:36,226
But good things happen too, you know?

1787
01:39:36,977 --> 01:39:38,812
Like you happened.

1788
01:39:40,522 --> 01:39:42,149
And she happened.

1789
01:39:42,941 --> 01:39:44,818
Hey, I don't...

1790
01:39:44,902 --> 01:39:48,780
And you are so bad at holding a baby.

-[LYLA] <i>We got your location, Peter.
</i>-Wait, wait. No, no!

You do not have my location. Over.

1793
01:39:53,660 --> 01:39:54,661
Send everyone.

1794
01:39:56,288 --> 01:39:59,541
No, no, no, Miles, I didn't know.
I promise you.

1795
01:39:59,625 --> 01:40:01,418
Please, man, let's talk about this.

1796
01:40:01,502 --> 01:40:02,336
We did.

1797
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:05,964
Good talk.

1801
01:40:25,442 --> 01:40:28,278
-Where does he think he's going?
-[Peter] Don't think he planned this out.

1802
01:40:28,362 --> 01:40:30,697
If I hadn't said it before, by the way,

1803
01:40:30,781 --> 01:40:32,616
you're a terrible mentor.

1804

[dramatic music playing]

1805
01:40:41,333 --> 01:40:44,753
He did just beat you,
so I'm not a terrible mentor.

1806
01:40:44,837 --> 01:40:47,381
[Miguel] You're both equally terrible.
Does that settle it?

1807
01:40:48,882 --> 01:40:51,176
Stop pretending
you know where you're going!

1808
01:40:51,260 --> 01:40:54,555
[Miles] Oh, I have a plan.
I just haven't told you yet.

1809

What are those, claws?

1813
01:41:32,593 --> 01:41:35,137
Dude, are you sure you're even Spider-Man?

1814
01:41:35,220 --> 01:41:36,638
[Miguel] Are you?

1815
01:41:36,722 --> 01:41:38,932
Who do you think you are? Really?

1816
01:41:41,852 --> 01:41:44,813
My name is Miles Morales.

1817
01:41:50,319 --> 01:41:53,363
I was bitten by a radioactive spider.

1818
01:41:55,282 --> 01:41:57,826
And I'm pretty sure
you know the rest, jerk!

1819
01:42:06,460 --> 01:42:08,170
Hey. What's up, man?

1820
01:42:10,214 --> 01:42:12,341
[Miguel]
You don't get it. You're an anomaly.

1821
01:42:12,424 --> 01:42:14,676
Not if you let me go home.

1822
01:42:15,135 --> 01:42:16,220
[Miguel grunts]

1823
01:42:18,347 --> 01:42:19,223
[Miles] Snitch!

1824
01:42:21,266 --> 01:42:23,519
[Miguel]
Everywhere you go, you're an anomaly.

1825
01:42:31,485 --> 01:42:34,154
You're the original anomaly.

1826
01:42:37,783 --> 01:42:38,951
Miguel!

1827
01:42:39,535 --> 01:42:43,747
[Miguel] The spider that gave you
your powers wasn't from your dimension.

1828
01:42:45,332 --> 01:42:47,334
It was never supposed to bite you.

1829
01:42:48,210 --> 01:42:49,044
Miguel, don't!

1830
01:42:49,127 --> 01:42:51,755
[Miguel] There's a world out there
with no Spider-Man to protect them

1831
01:42:51,839 --> 01:42:53,423
-because it bit you instead.
-No.

1832
01:42:53,507 --> 01:42:55,467
[Miguel]
You're not supposed to be Spider-Man.

1833
01:42:55,551 --> 01:42:57,970
No! You're lying. I'm Spider-Man!

1834
01:42:58,053 --> 01:42:59,513
[Miguel] You're a mistake!

1835
01:43:01,473 --> 01:43:05,102
If you hadn't been bit,
your Peter Parker would have lived.

1836
01:43:05,185 --> 01:43:07,813
Instead, he died saving you.

1837
01:43:08,814 --> 01:43:11,233
He would've stopped the collider
before it ever went off.

1838
01:43:11,316 --> 01:43:12,568
Spot wouldn't exist.

1839
01:43:12,651 --> 01:43:15,904
-And none of this would've happened.
-Peter. [groans]

1840
01:43:15,988 --> 01:43:20,409
And all this time, I have been

-No sign of him.

Better go check it out.

Now I'm here in the alley.
There's something unusual happening.

You were right.
You were right about everything.

Of course I'm right. I'm always right.

[in English] Miles, you're talking crazy.
What's going on?

2061

His name is Spot. He's my nemesis.

It's because I thought if you knew...

you wouldn't love me the same.

The superhero? He got bit by a spider?

Dad worked with Spider-Man.

Wait, wait.

Listen to me. Okay, look.

2188

You don't understand. I'm not from here.

Listen, okay?
This machine sent me here by mistake.

I was bit by a spider that gave me powers.

2197
02:09:11,418 --> 02:09:14,838
It wasn't supposed to bite me.
It was supposed to bite someone else.

2198
02:09:14,922 --> 02:09:16,089
Someone from here.

2199
02:09:16,924 --> 02:09:19,259
I don't belong here. I need to go home.

2200
02:09:19,843 --> 02:09:20,677
Okay?

2201
02:09:23,013 --> 02:09:25,682
I have an Uncle Aaron too. I had one.

-He was a bad guy called the Prowler.

He looked out for me.

He did a lot of bad things, but...

2205
02:09:34,525 --> 02:09:36,902
I knew he wanted to be good.

2206
02:09:36,985 --> 02:09:39,780
He just didn't know he had a choice,
but you do.

2207
02:09:40,739 --> 02:09:41,823
You can be a good guy.

02:09:45,911 --> 02:09:49,164
Please. Trust me.
I know you don't wanna be the Prowler.
